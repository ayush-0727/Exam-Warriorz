# Exam Warriorz

This project aims to build a web-based test generator for creating custom exams tailored to various competitive exams such as JEE, NEET, and GATE. Users can choose specific topics, difficulty levels, and the number of questions to generate unique, personalized tests. The platform will offer a user-friendly interface, supporting both students and educators in creating timed practice tests with detailed solutions. Features include question shuffling, randomization, and performance tracking. The goal is to provide a holistic user experience, helping students practice effectively for their exams. It will be a login-based web application which will allow users to track their progress over time with personalized dashboards showing scores, strengths, and areas for improvement.
